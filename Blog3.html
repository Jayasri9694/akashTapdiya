    <h1>If I Ever Get a Lover Just like Nia.</h1>
    <div class="blog-meta">Category: Habits | June 2, 2025</div>
    <div class="blog-content">
      <p>If I ever get a lover,
        it would have to be someone like Nia.
        Someone who gets mad at me every time I meet her
        not because I forgot the chocolates,
        but because I didn’t stay long enough
        the last time I was there.

        She’d ignore me for hours,
        pretending I don’t exist
        arms crossed, eyes looking away,
        like she’s really done with me this time.
        And then I’d tease her,
        “If you don’t talk nicely,
        I’ll just become Anik’s chachu instead.”
        And just like that,
        she’d get so damn jealous
        “No! You’re my chachu.”
        And suddenly, everything’s back to normal.
        The silence is over.
        The world is okay again.

        She never expects gifts.
        She never asks for more than my presence.
        Because she never knew me
        for the things I gave
        but for who I was.
        (And I never really gave anything,
        but still, she remembered me.)

        She’d cry if a photographer asked to click her,
        but the moment I raised the camera,
        her Akash chachu,
        she’d pose like a princess.

        She wouldn’t just hug me,
        she’d give me a jaadu ki jhappi,
        tight enough to fix everything
        I never said aloud.

        And if I ever fall in love
        I want it to be with someone
        who asks me to stay
        when I’m walking away.
        And when I say,
        “I really can’t...”
        she looks me in the eye and says,
        “Jao... niche utaro mujhe,”
        because of course
        I had her in my arms.

        And I want her to look at me
        the way Nia looks at me.
        Not like a lover,
        not like I’m supposed to impress her,
        but like she’s already sure of me.
        Like I’m her whole world
        in the simplest, truest sense.

        Like a 3-year-old baby looks
        at that one person
        because they don’t even know
        what breaking trust feels like.
        They just trust.

        Fully.
        Naturally.
        Without questions or fears.

        I want her to love me like that.
        With eyes that don’t know how to lie,
        with hands that hold tight for no reason,
        with silence that still feels full.

        I want to be loved like a child loves.
        Not the love that demands,
        but the love that waits by the door
        just to hear your voice.

        And maybe no one in this world
        could’ve gotten as lucky as I did
        to have a niece so obsessed with her chachu
        that now he knows exactly how he wants to be loved.

        Not with grand confessions.

        Not with flowers or poetry or praise.
        But with soft eyes,
        quiet presence,
        and a heart that gives
        without keeping score.

        That’s it.
        That’s all I want.
        To be loved the way a child loves
        with nothing in their hands,
        but everything in their heart.

        Just like Nia.
        Just like that.
